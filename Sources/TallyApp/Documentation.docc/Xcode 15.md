# Xcode 15

Xcode 15 enables you to develop, test, and distribute apps for all Apple platforms. Code and design your apps faster with enhanced code completion, interactive previews, and live animations. Use Git staging to craft your next commit without leaving your code. Explore and diagnose your test results with redesigned test reports with video recording. And start deploying seamlessly to TestFlight and the App Store from Xcode Cloud. Creating amazing apps has never been easier.

## Ready, set, code.
Xcode 15 is now 50% smaller on the Mac App Store, with downloadable simulator runtimes for all platforms. Enhanced code completion helps you write safer code faster, now referencing all your assets. And projects build faster thanks to improvements in the compiler and a brand-new linker, optimized for the multicore architecture of Apple silicon.

## Stay organized
The new Bookmark navigator helps you keep track of landmarks in your code and organize your tasks. Localization assets are streamlined in the new String Catalog, giving you a centralized way to review and update them. And documentation shines in Xcode 15, with a beautiful new design, and real-time preview.

## Swift and SwiftUI
Swift, SwiftUI, and Xcode 15 work together as one. Powered by the new Swift macros, Xcode Previews are easier to use and now work across SwiftUI, UIKit, and AppKit. The new interactive timeline helps you develop and design your widgets. And working with different platforms and devices is easier: you can choose them right in the preview canvas to make sure your views look great everywhere.
